# Revolutionizing Topic Modeling: Comparing ChatGPT and Machine Learning Models on Categorized Data Sets

# Executive Summary
Topic modeling is an essential tool in natural language processing (NLP) for discovering latent topics within a large corpus of text data. However,
traditional machine learning models may not be as effective in handling complex data sets with multiple categories. This raises the need for a
cutting-edge NLP technology that can accurately extract topics from categorized data. In this study, we compare the performance of ChatGPT, a
state-of-the-art language model, with traditional machine learning models in topic modeling on categorized data sets. The aim is to determine the
effectiveness of ChatGPT in extracting topics and how it compares with other machine learning models in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
